            <h1>Zach Thomas Final Project Idea</h1>
            <p>
            </br>
          My final project proposal is a wristband with an audio detector. It will vibrate when the audio level gets too high to alert the user they need to shut up.
          The idea came from when I was last home and my brothers and I kept waking up the baby in the house.
